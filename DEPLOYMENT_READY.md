## ⚠️ Important: Backend Services

Your app uses APIs for:
- ❌ CV extraction (Groq AI)
- ❌ Contact submissions
- ❌ Volunteer applications

**These don't work on GitHub Pages** because it's static hosting (frontend only).

### To Enable Full Features:
1. Deploy Express backend to Render/Railway/Vercel
2. Update API endpoints
3. Re-deploy frontend

**See:** DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md (has full backend deployment guide)
